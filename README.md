## Insights
- **Churn Overview**:
  - The overall churn rate is 26.86%, translating to 1,796 churned customers out of 6,687 total.
- **Churn by Data Usage**:
  - Customers consuming less than 5 GB of data have the highest churn rate (34.69%).
  - Customers using 10+ GB are more likely to stay, with only 27.72% churning.
- **Demographics**:
  - Seniors (38.22%) make up the largest group of churned customers.
  - Under 30s account for 23%, and others (24.71%) include all remaining age groups.
- **Top Churn Reasons**:
  - Nearly 45% of churn is due to competitor actions, especially:
    - Better offers (21.17%)
    - Better devices (20.75%)
  - The rest is linked to service dissatisfaction (attitude, pricing, product, network).
- **Age Group Analysis**:
  - Highest customer count is in the 39–48 age group, but highest churn rates occur in older age brackets (59–78).
  - This indicates older users are more likely to leave, even though they are fewer in number.
- **Geographic Trends**:
  - California (75%), Indiana (66.67%), and New Hampshire (62.5%) have the highest churn rates.
  - Lowest churn is seen in Idaho, North Dakota, Rhode Island (25%).

## Conclusion
The churn rate is moderately high at 26.86%, driven heavily by competition and poor engagement with older, low-data-usage customers. Seniors and users consuming less than 5 GB of data are the most vulnerable to leaving. Competitive offers and better devices from rivals account for nearly half of all churn.

## Recommendations
1. **Retain Low-Usage Customers**: Create targeted bundles for users consuming <5 GB, offering better value and flexibility.
2. **Engage Senior Customers**:
    - Improve communication channels tailored for older demographics.
    - Simplify device and service options to increase accessibility and satisfaction.
3. **Counter Competitor Offers**: Launch competitive pricing or exclusive loyalty deals.
4. **Improve Service Touchpoints**:
    - Train support staff and frontline service reps to enhance customer experience (14.19% left due to attitude).
    - Monitor and improve device and network quality.
5.**Geo-targeted Interventions**:
    - Investigate churn hotspots like California, Indiana, and NH and launch retention campaigns   in these regions.
